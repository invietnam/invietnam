Why inVietnam

There are various aspects of each urban center, each land. It is the appearance of a city or a land and the path through history that create the portrait of that city, land. In contemplating an object or going sightseeing in a place, people usually take interest in what is exposed before their eyes, but to understand, to love, or to live with it, people often trace back to the past, the history.

A city or a land itself is not an exception. The fate of a city or a land depends on its attitude towards its own past and history. If a city or a land knows how to love the past and to respect history, its current position will be more steady and the road to the future will be brighter.

The past and the history of a land or a city include various tangible and in tangible things. Relics and landscapes are an important part of the past, the history. Through relics and landscapes, we can see the attitude of our ancestors in dealing with the universe and with their people; we can see the image of many successive generations of those who had lived in that land; we can see the happiness and sadness, contentment and misery, worry and aspiration, sweat and blood of our ancestors on the long road through history and the past of the land.

People in the era of globalization are eagerly in search of both universal and humanity values. The farther and wider we travel, the more we need to turn round to observe our original face. Actually, the differentiation and uniqueness can not be detached from the past, or more precisely, a large part of it is determined by the past and its distinctive history.

Most of us have the need to understand history, or understand the past. And, obviously, the introduction of relics and landscapes is an essential task for each of us. In this way of thinking, we would like to introduce to our readers this mobile application:
